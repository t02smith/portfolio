# Portfolio Website

Every cliche Computer Scientist needs a personal website full of random information that no one will likely ever read. But it's a fun little project nonetheless getting to craft my own corner of the internet.

This website includes three main pages:

1. About me - Who am I? What do I enjoy doing? What do I look like? All great questions and all of which can be answered by heading to [this page](https://portfolio.t02smith.com/about).
2. Projects - What have I worked on that's I've deemed cool or impressive enough to talk about on this website? Take a look at [this page](https://portfolio.t02smith.com/projects).
3. Blog - Happy to read through some of my eternal wisdom? [This page](https://t02smith.com/blog) is what you're looking for.

This is currently deployed as a static web app to Microsoft's Azure until the monthly 50p charge empties my bank account and this website gets relegated to Raspberry Pi.
