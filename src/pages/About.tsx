                  I finished university achieving a First (at 75%) and learnt a hell of a lot on the way. Below I'll talk about some of the more interesting things I did during my time:
                </p>

                <div>
                  <b>My Third Year</b><br />
                  The bulk of my third year was spent on my project, <b>Using Blockchain for Video Game Distribution</b> (<a href="/#/projects?project=Blockware">click here</a>), but I did some other things that are worth mentioning too:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Cloud Application development</li>
                    <p>How cloud services like Azure and Google Cloud can be used to host just about anything. During this module I helped create a full-stack website called <b>Unitled Chore App</b> (<a href="/#/projects?project=Untitled+Chore+App">click here</a>) and created a version of <b>Quiplash</b> based off of the Jackbox game.</p>

                    <li>Advanced Databases</li>
                    <p>How do DBMS' work and how can they work at a large-scale over the internet and the globe? This module took a deep dive into how a DBMS system is created and the design choices that each one makes from organising data to managing queries over a distributed database. The coursework involved me writing an algorithm that would use a heuristic to optimise SQL queries.</p>

                    <li>Advanced Networks</li>
                    <p>What protocols should I use for my network and how should devices be arranged? This module had me researching various protocols that each target different use-cases and looking at how they work and how they compare to similar technologies. As part of this module I created <b>Wol-Kit</b> (<a href="/#/projects?project=wol-kit">click here</a>).</p>

                    <li>Web and Cloud Security</li>
                    <p>How can I secure my website and how can I test that it is secure? This module looked at various ways security can be increased on web-facing services, including common vulnerabilities and methods on how to methodically find them. During this module I worked on <b>RobPress</b> and <b>Rob the Bank</b> (<a href="/#/projects?project=RobPress+and+RobBank">click here</a>).</p>

                    {/* <li>Web Architecture and Hypertext Technology</li> */}
                  </ul>

                </div>

                {/* <div>
                <b>My Second Year</b><br />

              </div> */}
