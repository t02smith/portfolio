This repository shows the source code for the website you are looking at right now! This is currently being hosted as an **Azure Web App**.

I chose [Nuxt v3](https://nuxt.com/) for this project for may reasons, including:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is one of the nicest frameworks to work with
- [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) makes it really easy to add and update the content on this site
- Quality of life features such as no imports, `pages/` directory routing, SSR, ...
- TypeScript support

This page was initially created using React but I felt that Nuxt offered too many nice features and QoL changes. Moreover, the state management library [üçç Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) is excellent and a million _million_ times better than Redux is.

## üìñ Pages

This website presently has the following pages:

- _[/](/)_ The home page with the neat animation ([_that was stolen from here_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJNVramny9k))
- _[/projects?project={}](/projects)_ The page you're on right now! This is a collection of interesting projects I've worked on that I feel proud enough about them to share with you.
- _[/about](/about)_ Some more information about myself that isn't entirely code related, including some photos of me and the people in my life.
- _[/blog](/blog)_ (**In Draft**) A page for me to post blogs to to share my wisdom or thoughts with the world through this dark and dingey corner of the internet.
