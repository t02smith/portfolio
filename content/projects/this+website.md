This repository shows the source code for the website you are looking at right now! This is currently being hosted by **GitHub Pages** for _free_.

TypeScript was an obvious choice as static typing was very sorely missed during my time spent on [Untitled Chore App](/projects?Untitled+Chore+App) and allows me to easily understand this code when I return after months of leaving this code abandoned. SCSS makes writing CSS more concise and the support for mixins and placeholders allow me to reduce the amount of styling I need to write ([CSS nesting does look pretty nice though üëÄ](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/)).

## üìñ Pages

This website uses [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to display different content for different endpoints. Namely:

- _[/](/)_ The home page
- _[/projects?project={}](/#/projects)_ Showing off some of my projects
- _[/about](/#/about)_ Some information about myself
- _[/blog](/#/blog)_ Some blogs written by myself **TODO**
